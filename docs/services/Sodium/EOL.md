## What does this mean

It means that depending on what version of sodium your using which can be found in the about page at sodium-5h8.pages.dev/about/ or whatever domain your using now may no longer be reciving support or updates from the z1g Project.
- If your version is on the "EOL" section that means that your version if there is any problems wont be fixed or reveiwed by XSTARS and you should update immediatly. 
- If it says "phasing out" it means you should probably update sodium soon before it becomes a EOL release. 
- If it says "LTS" it means long term support which means your good for a while and dont need to upddate for a while. 
- If it says "current" your on the latest release. 
- If it says "development" then its not out / will be out soon.

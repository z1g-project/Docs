# Sodium

![image](https://github.com/z1g-project/sodium/blob/master/sodium-static/public/sodium.png?raw=true)

This was my submission to the Titanium Network Proxathon!

## Features

Sodium has various Features that work great and were tested on some enrolled Chromebooks recently (Shoutout xN1ghtmare for testing)
Some of the features of sodium are:

- Auto-Stealth Pages (Loads the pages within the current page you are on instead of loading the page classicly with the example.com/uv/service/)
- Tab Cloaking - Changeable Title and Icon
- Multiple Themes - Dark (default), Sodium, Light, and AMOLED
- Nice UV Visual Appearance - Custom CSS for UV!
- Performance Metrics - This is what qualifies this as Power Users, but it tells you the transfer Rate, latency between you and the bare server, and of course the FPS!
- Battery & Time Displays ***NOTE ONLY WORKS ON CHROMIUM-BASED BROWSERS Check the compatibility checker in settings to see if it's available in your browser***
- Wide Variety of games! - Total of 33 Games and 15 Apps!
- Custom CSS Editor **BETA** - Uses Monaco CSS Editor and is still in the works!
- HyperTabs UI **BETA** - HyperTabs Sodium Edition!
- Emergency Switch Feature - A functional bindable keybind with a URL that when you press the button exits the page you are on and redirects to that URL!
- Customizable! - Sodium has tons of other customization options for you to play with!

## Setup & installation

To set up Sodium, it is simple. Below are some instructions to get you started!

**NOTE that as of right now we don't have quick deployments set up, but I plan on adding support for this at some point in the future.

### Steps

- Fork This Repository, Clone into the repository by using: `git clone https://github.com/z1g-project/sodium.git`, or download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/z1g-project/sodium/releases) and extract it to your deployments directory.
- Make sure that you have NodeJS 18.x installed to check this in your operating system of choice command line or terminal type: `Node --Version` and if it says 18.0.0 or anything later than that you are fine. If you need to install or update NodeJS Please Refer to [This Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Next, after all these things have been completed. Please make sure you are in the directory with all the files inside it. Next Run `npm i` or `npm install` (they are the same command) and wait for it to finish installing Dependencies.

> ⚠️ Note if you are on Replit, Glitch, Heroku (or any other host that doesn't allow proxies), This Repository will probably automatically flag your repository. Check out how to Bypass these Restrictions here: [Bypassing Restrictions](https://github.com/holy-unblocker/website-aio/wiki/Circumventing-deployment-restrictions)

- Once all dependencies are installed you may run `npm start` to start the HTTP Server. If you wish to use a site such as Cloudflare pages or any other static hosts, it is possible you need to follow [This guide](static-hosting)
